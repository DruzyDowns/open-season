This is a demo React app for a SharpSpring coding test. The application fetches album data from the Apple Music database with a simple search query, filters the results, and displays the album metadata as cards on the page.
This example was created using create-react-app, along ith CRACO to allow for the use of the Tailwind CSS library.

Then run `npm run start` to enable the development server with craco.
